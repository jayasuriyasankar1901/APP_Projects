💻 Advanced Programming Practices - Project
A collection of advanced Java-based projects built under the Advanced Programming Practices course at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST).
These projects demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming, GUI Design, Database Connectivity, and Algorithmic Logic using Java and MySQL.

🧮 Project 1: CalculatorApp
🔹 Overview
A modern, minimalistic calculator GUI built using Java Swing, featuring a custom stack-based expression evaluator.
It supports arithmetic operations, parentheses, decimals, and interactive button control for a smooth calculation experience.

🔹 Key Features
Stack-based expression evaluation (+, -, *, /, and ())
Real-time input display (all expressions visible at once)
Backspace (←) and Clear (C) functionalities
Clean, realistic layout using GridLayout
Error handling for invalid expressions and divide-by-zero cases
🔹 Folder Structure
CalculatorApp/ │ ├── src/ │ └── CalculatorApp.java

🔹 How to Run
bash cd CalculatorApp/src javac CalculatorApp.java java CalculatorApp

🗄️ Project 2: StudentDBApp 🔹 Overview

A Java + MySQL based database project that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. It demonstrates how to connect Java programs to MySQL databases using the JDBC API and MySQL Connector/J driver.

🔹 Key Features

Connects Java with MySQL seamlessly

Allows adding, updating, and deleting student records

Displays student data in a readable format

Uses prepared statements for secure SQL queries

Handles exceptions and database connectivity errors gracefully

🔹 Folder Structure StudentDBApp/ │ ├── src/ │ └── StudentDBApp.java │ ├── lib/ │ └── mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar │ └── database/ └── studentdb.sql

🔹 Database Setup

Open your MySQL terminal or Workbench.

Run the following commands:

CREATE DATABASE StudentDB; USE StudentDB;

Import the SQL script file studentdb.sql inside the database/ folder to create the table:

SOURCE path/to/studentdb.sql;

🔹 MySQL Connector Setup

Ensure the MySQL Connector/J (mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar) is added to your classpath.

If you are compiling via terminal:

Windows (CMD):

cd StudentDBApp/src javac -cp .;../lib/mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar StudentDBApp.java java -cp .;../lib/mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar StudentDBApp

Mac/Linux (Terminal):

cd StudentDBApp/src javac -cp .:../lib/mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar StudentDBApp.java java -cp .:../lib/mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar StudentDBApp
